            to help me to oraganize this restuarant.Belong from poor family,where all family memebers are totally 
            depend to one person that is 'father', where the requirements is high, but source income is low.By low income, and more memebers

            </p>
            <br>

           <p class="ne">  myself Dinesh Aidee,I am 20 years old. i am currently studying BE-computer Engineering in pokhara university.After i passed my Higher level, i thought if i went to foreign country, it will meaning less.So i thought i Lived in here to  first completing my education."Engineer is my aim " this aim is also my father to becoming me Engineer and all of my family memebers.
             But The problem arises the fees is costly. Around 6 lakh which is very high amount of my family memebers. my family give me support in study. They take a loan from bank.They all wants to see me to becoming an Engineer.SO Now i study.

          <p class="ne">  Along the Study, i thought if i any work,which can be help my family as well as helping for me in future. I take advice from the senior Brothers and sisters. The give different advice which is  good. 
                  </p>
             <br><br>

         <p class="ne">   After that, i think if i Go in Hotel side, it will more helpful for me. i think if i open this restuarant where the tourists come in rapidly and local people . i helps alot for me as well as customers who take the services which we provided.
            <br><br>
          
            As we know,our country nepal is one of the best place for tourism.There are alot of beautiful places and alot of river, lake.
            Every year  many tourists come in our country for seeing the places.

            <br>
            In Nepal, There are some places where the tourism is possible but facility is zero.so i think the hotel, restuarant this type of things will help the tourism and the tourists can take the food, rest and as well as Stay there for any two days.
            it will more attracted the tourist to come there and visit.I will help a lot  for local people who come from far places but stay there in 2 days.

        <br><br>

        So i think, i if i open this restuarant in that place, it may be helpful for tourism.
        <br>
         The all services and faciliates provided ..By ..Dmeal restuarant..
